 Diffusion Current Transients from Spherical Cap Theory During Electrocrystallization

# Evans' Theory for Electrocrystallization

Evans' theory describes the current transient behavior during metal electrodeposition, considering the influence of nucleation rate and diffusion-controlled growth. The number of nucleation sites follows an exponential activation law, while the active surface area expands with a diffusion-limited radius. The transient current follows:

```
$$I(t) = I_0 (1 - e^{-At}) t^{1/2}$$
```

where \( I_0 \) is a material-dependent prefactor. This theory is particularly useful for analyzing electrochemical deposition processes in metals like **silver (Ag), lithium (Li), and magnesium (Mg)**. The model predicts an initial increase in current due to growing nucleation sites, followed by a decay as diffusion dominates.
